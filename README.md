Leaflet.polydrag
----------------

Enable dragging for Leaflet polygons and polylines.

This is a quick and simple plugin for leaflet that enables dragging polygons.
Developed against Leaflet 0.4.2.  See index.html for a usage example.

I'm not actively maintaining this at the moment, but @snkashis's fork has
a branch that, as of this writing, is up-to-date with current Leaflet. You
can find it here: https://github.com/snkashis/leaflet.polydrag/tree/handler_fix
